# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
print(3+5)

# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
print(10/2)
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
print(2*3)
# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length = 2
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width = 4
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area = length * width
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print(f'the result is {area}')

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables.
length = 5
width = 3
area = length * width 
print(f"if the length of a rectangle is {length}, and the width is {width}, then the area is: {area}")
